# Task List Manager --- Final-project-305
Daniel and Xavier

This Task List Manager is designed to help you manage any tasks you may have. You are able to write down a title, the due date, the priority, and the description of the task. There is client side and back end validaiton to ensure that you write down a title and a due date, but you aren't able to spoof the title name, due date name, or priority values. Once submitted, there is a confirmation page along with a button to send you back to the current tasks.

There is a navigation button to help you view not only your current tasks, but to also add a new task, view your completed tasks and your deleted tasks. You are able to complete or delete a task on the current tasks page. On both the completed and deleted tasks pages, you are able to restore your tasks back to the current tasks page. Alternatively, you are able to delete all your completed and deleted tasks permanently.

There is responsiveness for mobile, tablets, and desktop. There are also lots of buttons on the pages to ensure that the web page is user friendly. You are able to click the headings to reliably go back to the current tasks page, and there is a "green +" on the current tasks, completed and deleted tasks to help show where to go to add another task. Finally, there is a "sort by date" button on the current tasks to sort your tasks based on date, the closest being on top and the furthest being on bottom.

For limitations, there isn't a way to permanently delete tasks individually. You are only able to do that through deleting all the tasks. Also, sorting the tasks won't permanently sort them, meaning they won't stay sorted if you add, delete or complete a task.
